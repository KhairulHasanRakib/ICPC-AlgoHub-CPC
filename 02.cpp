/*
Imagine you have a magical garden where flowers bloom in a specific pattern.
In the first day, a single flower blooms.
On the second day, two flowers bloom, and
On the third day, three flowers bloom.
This pattern continues. Write a program to calculate the minimum number of days needed for the garden to reach a total of at least 100 flowers.
